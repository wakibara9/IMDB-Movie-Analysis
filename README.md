Aggregation pipeline via MongoDB and Jupyter Notebooks to convert a dataset into useful facts for construction of charts for analysis.
This is an **archive** - it is no longer fully functional due to loss of access to the original MongoDB cluster and its files that it was hosted on.
This Github repository serves as an archive of this project, showcasing my skills and capabilities that resulted from it.

It involved usage of Python, MongoDB, and Jupyter Notebooks. 
Python - alongside matplotlib and PANDAS, I created scatterplots of the data from the database
MongoDB - responsible for hosting the original files
Jupyter Notebooks - (at the time) used as a way to host it on GitHub.
